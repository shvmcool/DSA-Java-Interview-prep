// When we use Greedy ? 
//Sorting by End Time â†’ Optimal Choice
//If we sort the intervals by their end time, we can always keep the interval that ends the earliest.
//This is a greedy choice because it leaves the most room for upcoming intervals.

//If it does overlap, remove the current interval,
//since keeping the one with the earliest end time is the greedy choice.
